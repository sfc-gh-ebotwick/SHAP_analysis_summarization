# SHAP_analysis_summarization

## WIP Demo to Achieve the Following

- Use Cortex Analyst to pull input data associated with a mortgage loan application
- Retrieve a trained loan-approval prediction model from Snowflake's Model Registry
- Pass in the input values to the model endpoint and use built-in Explainability features to compute shapley values
- Visualize Shapley values in Streamlit
- Pass in array of actuals and shapley values and use Cortex to call a user-specified LLM to summarize key characterstics of why a certain loan application was approved or denied
